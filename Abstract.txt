PROJECT DOCUMENTATION: AI COVER LETTER NEXUS
================================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI Cover Letter Nexus is a sophisticated Single Page Application (SPA) developed 
to optimize the job application workflow. By integrating the Google Gemini API 
(Model: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025), the platform autonomously generates 
tailored, professional cover letters. It synthesizes a candidate’s resume with 
specific job descriptions to produce persuasive, fact-based narratives, significantly 
reducing the time and effort required for high-quality job applications.

The application prioritizes data privacy, processing all documents client-side, 
and offers a modern, responsive user interface designed for efficiency.

2. TECHNOLOGY STACK & PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project is engineered using a modern, type-safe frontend architecture:

A. Core Languages
   *   TypeScript (v5.x): Ensures code reliability and maintainability through 
       static typing.
   *   HTML5 / CSS3: Provides the semantic structure and visual styling.

B. Frameworks & Libraries
   *   React (v19): Utilizes functional components and hooks for state management 
       and efficient DOM updates.
   *   Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used to create a custom, 
       responsive, dark-themed design system.
   *   Google GenAI SDK (@google/genai): Facilitates secure and efficient 
       communication with the Gemini inference engine.

C. Client-Side Utilities
   *   pdfjs-dist: Parses PDF binary data within the browser to extract text.
   *   mammoth.js: Converts .docx (Microsoft Word) files to raw text strings.
   *   jspdf: Enables the programmatic generation of downloadable PDF documents.

3. OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW (HOW IT WORKS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application follows a linear, four-stage process:

Stage 1: Input & Parsing
Users input data via two primary methods: direct text pasting or file upload. 
The application supports Drag-and-Drop for .txt, .md, .pdf, and .docx files. 
When a file is uploaded, the browser-based parsing engines immediately extract 
the raw text content without sending files to an external server.

Stage 2: Context Configuration
Users may optionally provide "Additional Instructions" (e.g., "Emphasize leadership") 
to guide the tone and focus of the letter. The system also attempts to intelligently 
extract the candidate's name from the resume to personalize the sign-off.

Stage 3: AI Synthesis
The application constructs a comprehensive prompt combining the Job Description, 
Resume Content, Candidate Name, and Instructions. This payload is sent to the 
Gemini 2.5 API with strict system instructions to:
   *   Maintain a 135-word limit.
   *   Adhere strictly to factual data from the resume.
   *   Use a formal business tone.

Stage 4: Rendering & Export
The generated response is rendered in an editable text area. Users can refine 
the text manually and then export the final document as a plain text file or 
a professionally formatted PDF.

4. KEY ADVANTAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   Data Privacy: No backend storage. All file parsing occurs locally in the 
    user's browser, ensuring sensitive resume data never persists on our servers.
*   Precision: The AI is instructed to avoid hallucination, ensuring that all 
    claims in the cover letter are backed by the provided resume.
*   Efficiency: Reduces the drafting process from hours to seconds.
*   Professional Formatting: The integrated PDF generator ensures the final 
    output adheres to business documentation standards (margins, fonts, layout).
*   User Experience: Features a clutter-free, dark-mode interface with clear 
    visual feedback (loading states, success notifications).

5. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   Modern Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
*   Active Internet Connection (for Gemini API communication)
*   Valid Google Gemini API Key
